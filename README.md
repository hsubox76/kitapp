# K.I.T.

An app for keeping in touch with your friends and family, or a CRM for your personal life.

## TODO

- Make sure notification scheduling is updated in all possible cases
- Contact notes - should show up in Event View
- Set up local storage / offline capability
- Confirmation on "cancel" event
- Event history where you can view Done and Canceled events
- Custom time range settings (how far in future to add new events, how far in future to count as "soon" on Upcoming page)
- Garbage collect really old events
- Push notifications?
